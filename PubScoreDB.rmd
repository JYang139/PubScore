#PubScoreDB

Instead of searching PubMed for gene-term pairs, a few pre-thought terms can be used and
a database containing only this information, queried. 

The database will have three columns : Gene; Term; and Counts. 

It will accept the output of get_literature_score, provided that it is from the same month.
