\usage{
get_literature_score(gene, terms_of_interest, is.list = FALSE,
  max_score = Inf, wait_time = 0, show_progress = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{The gene which you want to calculate the literature_score for, or a vector with multiple genes}

\item{terms_of_interest}{A list of terms of interest related to the topic you want to find the relevance for}

\item{is.list}{If you are searching a single gene or a list of genes. Defaults to false (single gene)}

\item{max_score}{A cutoff for maximum numbers of search. Useful for avoiding outlier relations
weighting too much. Defaults to Inf.}

\item{wait_time}{How long should be the interval between two requests to the ENTREZ database when it fails.
Defaults to 0. In seconds.}

\item{show_progress}{If TRUE, a progress bar is displayed. Defaults to True.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, will display the index of the search occuring. Defaults to false.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the literature scores.
}
\description{
Calculates the importance score for a given gene.
The importance score is the total counts of articles in the pubmed
database that are a result for that gene AND each term of a list
}
