# Introduction

PubScore is an R package with 2 goals :
- (1) provide a quantitative score of the relevance of a list of genes regarding any topic a
- (2)  visualize combinations of genes and terms of interest interactively.

Querying the PubMed, PubScore gets the article count for  gene/term combination and creates a  score to calculate the literature enrichment for a list of genes.


Let's start by installing the package. 


Let's explore how to calculate a literature score for selected genes, 
and estimate the likelihood of such a score (or higher) happening by chance. 

We will use the scDengue dataset, of dengue-infected monocytes, from the FCBF package. 
We will see the FCBF selected genes are already related in the literature to dengue. 

```{r}
BiocManager::install("PubScore")

library("FCBF")
library('SummarizedExperiment')
library(PubScore)
# load expression data
data(scDengue)
```

Let's run the FCBF algorithm to select genes that might be relevant 
to understand


```{r}
infection <- SummarizedExperiment::colData(scDengue)
target <- infection$infection

exprs <- as.data.frame(SummarizedExperiment::assay(scDengue,'logcounts'))
discrete_expression <- as.data.frame(FCBF::discretize_exprs(exprs))

fcbf_features <- fcbf(discrete_expression, target, thresh = 0.05, verbose = FALSE)
total_features <- rownames(exprs)
head(fcbf_features)
```



The scDengue dataset is using Ensemble IDs, and usually papers use gene symbols 
(as TP53 and CD3D). biomaRt can fix this. 

```{r}
library(biomaRt)

ensembl = useMart("ensembl",dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl")
reference = biomaRt::getBM(attributes = c('ensembl_gene_id', 'hgnc_symbol'), 
              mart = ensembl)

total_genes <- reference[reference$ensembl_gene_id %in% total_features,]$hgnc_symbol

fcbf_genes<- reference[reference$ensembl_gene_id %in% rownames(fcbf_features),]$hgnc_symbol
```

Unfortunately, not all genes in the datasets had an equivalent gene symbol.
PubScore does not deal with empty gene-names, so we need to remove them

```{r}
total_genes <- total_genes[total_genes != ""]
fcbf_genes <- fcbf_genes[fcbf_genes != ""]
```


First let's see the association of the fcbf_genes with dengue-related terms.
The PubScore package queries the PubMed database, so it takes about 0.7s for 
each search. 

As we have 62 genes and 2 terms, 62 * 0.7 = 43.8 s, the function should
take less than a  minute to run.

```{r}
terms_of_interest <- c('Dengue')

literature_object <- PubScore::get_literature_score(gene = fcbf_genes,is.list = T,terms_of_interest = terms_of_interest)

```

With the literature object, now we can visualize the gene-term relationships 
with the plot_literature_score function. 

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
p <- plot_literature_score(plot_counts = literature_object$counts, return_ggplot = T)
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```


There are a few genes that have been related to dengue previously, such as MAVS. There is a Nature Immunology research highligh entitled "Dengue suppresses MAVS". 
(www.nature.com/articles/ni.3527)

Qualitatetively, it seems that indeed some of these genes are already related to Dengue. 
But how many Dengue-related genes would I expect by chance alone?

For this, we need to estimate the null distribution of the scores by randomly selecting
genes. That is the goal of the 'test_literature_score' function. 

WARNING: This functions takes 6 hours to run. That is because a lot of requests are made to
pubmed. We ran it and made the final output available here so you don't need it. 
But feel free to do it. 

```{r eval = FALSE} 
literature_object <- test_literature_score(literature_object, total_genes)
save(literature_object, file= '../literature_object.RData')
load('../literature_object.RData')

literature_object$all_gene_combinations <- literature_object$all_gene_combinations[literature_object$all_gene_combinations$Var2 == 'Dengue',]
```


We will re-do the p-value estimation just to be really clear about it. 
```{r}
simulation_of_literature_null <- literature_object$all_gene_combinations

message('Running 100000 simulations')
      distribution_of_scores <- c()
      for (i in seq_len(100000)){    
        genes_to_sample_now <- sample(total_genes, 62)
        simu_now <- simulation_of_literature_null[simulation_of_literature_null$Gene %in% genes_to_sample_now,]$count
        list_score <- sum(simu_now) / 62
        distribution_of_scores <- c(distribution_of_scores,list_score )
        
      }
      
      distribution_of_scores<- data.frame(d = distribution_of_scores)
      
score <- literature_object$list_literature_score
      

  pvalue <-sum(distribution_of_scores[,1] >= score)/length(distribution_of_scores[,1])
    
    
    print('The p-value by simulation is:')
    print(pvalue) 
      
```

Hm, the pvalue indicates that the list of genes obtained is not more related 
to Dengue than what we would expect by chance. This might be a sign that FCBF
did not work very well for this discretization/dataset. Or that the information 
regarding the association of these genes to Dengue  is largely  absent from the 
literature.

Let's look at the top genes associated with Dengue in the literature.


```{r}
literature_object$all_gene_combinations[order(literature_object$all_gene_combinations$count, decreasing = T),][1:20]
```


Hm there are clearly problems with these genes... they are ambiguous!
We will have to blacklist a few genes to avoid these outliers. 

Genes blacklisted :


```{r}
literature_object$all_gene_combinations[order(literature_object$all_gene_combinations$count, decreasing = T),]$Gene[1:20]
black_list <-
  c(
  "PC",
  "JUN" ,
  "IMPACT",
  "ACHE",
  "SRI" ,
  "SET"  ,
  "CS" ,
  "PROC"   ,
  "MET" ,
  "SHE"   ,
  "CAD"  ,
  "DDT",
  "PIGS"   ,
  "SARS" ,
  "REST" ,
  "GC",
  "CP",
  "STAR",
  "SI"
  )
```

From the first 20, only 'HLA-A' seems like a true positive. Let's look further.


```{r}
literature_object$all_gene_combinations[order(literature_object$all_gene_combinations$count, decreasing = T),]$Gene[21:40]

black_list <-
  c( black_list,
  "GAN",
  "MARS" ,
  "SDS",
  "AGA",
  "NHS" ,
  "CPE"  ,
  "POR" ,
  "MAX"   ,
  "CAT" ,
  "LUM"   ,
  "ANG"  ,
  "POLE",
  "CLOCK"
  )
```

More fakers. Let's keep digging.


```{r}
literature_object$all_gene_combinations[order(literature_object$all_gene_combinations$count, decreasing = T),]$Gene[41:60]

black_list <-
  c( black_list,
  "TANK",
  "ITCH" ,
  "SDS",
  "AES",
  "CIC" ,
  "FST"  ,
  "CAPS" ,
  "COPE"   ,
  "F2" ,
  "AFM"    ,
  "SPR"  ,
  "PALM",
  "C2"
  )
```

More fakers. Let's keep digging.


```{r}
literature_object$all_gene_combinations[order(literature_object$all_gene_combinations$count, decreasing = T),]$Gene[61:80]

black_list <-
  c( black_list,
  "BAD",
  "GPI" ,
  "CA2",
  "SMS",
  "INVS" ,
  "WARS"  ,
  "HP" ,
  "GAL"   ,
  "SON" ,
  "AFM"
  )
```

More fakers. Let's keep digging.


```{r}
literature_object$all_gene_combinations[order(literature_object$all_gene_combinations$count, decreasing = T),]$Gene[81:100]

black_list <-
  c( black_list,
  "BORA",
  "MBP" ,
  "MAK",
  "MALL",
  "COIL" ,
  "CAST " 
  )
save(black_list,file = 'blacklist.RData')

```

Let's see if there are any blacklisted genes in the FCBF-selected ones. 

```{r}
any(fcbf_genes %in% black_list)
```

Uhul, there aren't any! Let's try the simulation again. 


```{r}
simulation_of_literature_null <- literature_object$all_gene_combinations[!literature_object$all_gene_combinations$Gene %in% black_list,]

message('Running 100000 simulations')
      distribution_of_scores <- c()
      for (i in seq_len(100000)){    
        genes_to_sample_now <- sample(total_genes, 62)
        simu_now <- simulation_of_literature_null[simulation_of_literature_null$Gene %in% genes_to_sample_now,]$count
        list_score <- sum(simu_now) / 62
        distribution_of_scores <- c(distribution_of_scores,list_score )
        
      }
      
      distribution_of_scores<- data.frame(d = distribution_of_scores)
      
score <- literature_object$list_literature_score
      

  pvalue <-sum(distribution_of_scores[,1] >= score)/length(distribution_of_scores[,1])
    
    
    print('The p-value by simulation is:')
    print(pvalue) 
```

0.11197. Ok, it is a higher score than expected by random in 88% of the cases. It is not that bad. 
The threshold of 95% is rather arbitrary and there is a big movement to reject the hard 
definition of statistical significance.
